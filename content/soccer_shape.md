# Soccer-Shape Training Documentation

## Overview

Soccer-shape training is a specialized conditioning methodology designed to replicate the physiological demands of soccer match play. Unlike traditional endurance training, soccer-shape sessions incorporate intermittent high-intensity efforts with active recovery, reflecting the stop-start nature of the game.

## 1. Soccer-Shape Training Overview

### Physiological Rationale

Soccer is characterized by:
- **Intermittent activity**: Alternating between high-intensity efforts (sprints, jumps, tackles) and low-intensity recovery (jogging, walking)
- **Variable movement patterns**: Linear running, change of direction (COD), acceleration, deceleration
- **Energy system demands**: Primarily aerobic base with repeated anaerobic bursts
- **Game-specific demands**: 90-minute matches with ~10-15km total distance, but only 2-3% at maximum intensity

### Training Goals

Soccer-shape training targets:
1. **Repeated Sprint Ability (RSA)**: Ability to maintain sprint performance across multiple efforts
2. **Change of Direction (COD)**: Neuromotor control and efficiency in directional changes
3. **Aerobic Power**: VO₂ max and lactate threshold improvements
4. **Anaerobic Capacity**: Short-duration high-intensity work capacity
5. **Game Readiness**: Physical conditioning that directly transfers to match performance

### Key Principles

- **Sport-specific movement patterns**: Shuttle runs, field sprints, agility work
- **Intermittent loading**: High-intensity work with incomplete recovery
- **Progressive overload**: Gradually increasing volume, intensity, or density
- **Recovery integration**: Active recovery periods that simulate game conditions
- **Position-specific adaptations**: Variations for different playing positions

### Load Calculation Integration

Soccer-shape sessions integrate with the universal `LoadCalculationEngine`:

**Load Calculation Methods**:
1. **Zone-Based Load** (preferred): Uses Z1-Z5 zone distribution with zone multipliers
   - Z1: 1.0x multiplier
   - Z2: 2.0x multiplier
   - Z3: 4.0x multiplier
   - Z4: 7.0x multiplier
   - Z5: 10.0x multiplier

2. **RPE × Duration** (fallback): If zone data unavailable
   - RPE 1-2: Z1 intensity
   - RPE 3-4: Z2 intensity
   - RPE 5-6: Z3 intensity
   - RPE 7-8: Z4 intensity
   - RPE 9-10: Z5 intensity

3. **HR-Based TRIMP** (if HR data available): Most accurate for load calculation

**Example Load Calculation**:
- **Session**: 6×400m with 90s recovery
- **Structure**: 10min warm-up (Z1), 6×90s work (Z4), 6×90s recovery (Z1), 10min cool-down (Z1)
- **Zone Distribution**: Z1: 25min, Z4: 9min
- **Load Calculation**: (25 × 1.0) + (9 × 7.0) = 25 + 63 = 88 load points

## 8. Integration Points

### LoadCalculator Integration

Soccer-shape sessions automatically integrate with `LoadCalculationEngine`:

```javascript
// Example session structure for load calculation
const session = {
    duration_minutes: 45,
    zone_distribution: {
        Z1: 25,  // Warm-up, recovery, cool-down
        Z4: 9    // High-intensity work
    },
    modality: 'running',
    adaptation: 'repeated_sprint_ability'
};

const loadResult = LoadCalculationEngine.compute_load(session);
// Returns: { total_load: 88, method_used: 'Zone_RPE', confidence: 0.85 }
```

### ExerciseAdapter Substitution System

Soccer-shape sessions can be substituted using the `SubstitutionEngine`:

**Compatible Substitutions**:
- **Running track sessions** → Cycling (endurance/VO2) or Swimming (aerobic/threshold)
- **Field shuttles** → Agility ladders, cone drills, or bodyweight COD work
- **Hill sprints** → Resistance sprints (sled, parachute, partner) or stadium steps
- **Small-sided games** → Game simulation drills, tactical training, or sport-specific conditioning

**Substitution Rules**:
- Maintain same adaptation tags (e.g., RSA → RSA-compatible work)
- Preserve load equivalence (±10% variance acceptable)
- Adjust for equipment availability
- Consider time constraints and environmental factors

### Seasonal Training Phases

Soccer-shape training integrates with seasonal periodization:

**Pre-Season** (6-8 weeks before competition):
- **Focus**: High volume, build aerobic base and RSA
- **Frequency**: 4-5 sessions per week
- **Intensity**: Mix of Z3-Z4-Z5
- **Sessions**: 400m repeats, shuttles, hill work, small-sided games

**In-Season** (Competition period):
- **Focus**: Maintain fitness, game readiness
- **Frequency**: 2-3 sessions per week (around match schedule)
- **Intensity**: Primarily Z4-Z5 (high quality, lower volume)
- **Sessions**: Sprint-recovery, small-sided games, position-specific work

**Post-Season** (Active recovery):
- **Focus**: Recovery, light maintenance
- **Frequency**: 1-2 sessions per week
- **Intensity**: Z2-Z3 (low intensity, enjoyable)
- **Sessions**: Easy field work, light agility, recreational play

**Off-Season** (Base building):
- **Focus**: Aerobic base, strength, skill development
- **Frequency**: 3-4 sessions per week
- **Intensity**: Z2-Z3 with occasional Z4
- **Sessions**: Long aerobic work, tempo runs, skill-based conditioning

### Injury Prevention Protocols

Soccer-shape sessions integrate with `PreventionProtocols.js`:

**Pre-Session Screening**:
- Check for current injuries or limitations
- Review recent training load (avoid if high load detected)
- Assess readiness (sleep, stress, fatigue)

**Session Modifications**:
- **Knee Issues**: Reduce COD work, avoid deep cuts, focus on linear work
- **Hamstring Concerns**: Reduce sprint volume, increase warm-up, add eccentric work
- **Ankle Problems**: Avoid high-speed COD, use flat surfaces, ankle strengthening
- **Lower Back**: Reduce impact, focus on aerobic work, avoid excessive twisting

**Post-Session Recovery**:
- Monitor for injury signs (pain, tightness, swelling)
- Recommend recovery protocols (stretching, foam rolling, ice)
- Adjust subsequent sessions based on feedback

## 9. Troubleshooting

3. **Extreme Cold**: Extended warm-up, layer clothing, indoor alternatives
4. **Poor Air Quality**: Indoor alternatives, reduce intensity, postpone if severe

#### 9.4 Equipment Limitations
**Problem**: Missing required equipment (cones, balls, hills).

**Solutions**:
1. **No Cones**: Use household items (bottles, bags, shoes) or natural markers (trees, rocks)
2. **No Balls**: Focus on running-based sessions (shuttles, sprints, repeats)
3. **No Hills**: Use treadmill with incline, stadium steps, or resistance sprints
4. **No Field**: Use indoor facilities, park, or modify to fit available space

#### 9.5 Time Constraints
**Problem**: Cannot complete full session due to time limitations.

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce volume (fewer sets) while maintaining intensity
2. Reduce recovery time (maintain work quality)
3. Focus on high-impact sessions (sprint-recovery, small-sided games)
4. Split sessions (morning/evening, or across days)

#### 9.6 Fatigue or Overtraining
**Problem**: Excessive fatigue, decreased performance, persistent soreness.

**Solutions**:
1. Reduce volume by 50% for 1-2 weeks
2. Increase recovery time between sessions (72h instead of 48h)
3. Focus on Z2-Z3 work (aerobic base, recovery)
4. Ensure adequate sleep, nutrition, hydration
5. Consider deload week (light activity, no high-intensity work)

#### 9.7 Injury Management
**Problem**: Current injury or pain during/after sessions.

**Solutions**:
1. **Stop Immediately**: If experiencing pain (not just discomfort)
2. **Modify Sessions**: Reduce intensity, avoid affected movements
3. **Substitute**: Use alternative exercises that don't stress injury
4. **Seek Professional Help**: Consult physiotherapist or sports medicine doctor
5. **Gradual Return**: Follow progressive return-to-play protocol

## 10. Testing and Measurement

### Performance Testing

**Yo-Yo Intermittent Test**:
- **Purpose**: Measure intermittent fitness and RSA
- **Protocol**: Progressive 20m shuttle runs until exhaustion
- **Frequency**: Every 6-8 weeks
- **Integration**: Use Yo-Yo test shape sessions as training tool

**30-15 Intermittent Fitness Test**:
- **Purpose**: Measure intermittent fitness and game readiness
- **Protocol**: 30s run / 15s walk intervals until exhaustion
- **Frequency**: Every 6-8 weeks
- **Integration**: Use 30-15 IFT shape sessions as training tool

**Sprint Performance**:
- **Purpose**: Measure acceleration and top speed
- **Protocol**: 40m sprint time, 10m split time
- **Frequency**: Every 4-6 weeks
- **Integration**: Use sprint-recovery intervals to develop

**Change of Direction**:
- **Purpose**: Measure COD efficiency and agility
- **Protocol**: 505 COD test, T-test, Illinois agility test
- **Frequency**: Every 6-8 weeks
- **Integration**: Use shuttle pyramid and agility primers to develop

### Load Monitoring

**Weekly Load Tracking**:
- Track total weekly load (Z4-Z5 minutes)
- Monitor load progression (10% weekly increase maximum)
- Ensure adequate recovery (48h between high-intensity sessions)
- Adjust volume based on readiness and performance

**Session Load Calculation**:
- Use `LoadCalculationEngine` to calculate session load
- Track load trends over time
- Identify load spikes (triggers for recovery days)
- Optimize load distribution across week
