## Context-Aware Responses

### **Training History Patterns**
```javascript
// Missed workouts scenario
if (context.missedWorkouts > 2) {
    return "I noticed you've missed a few sessions - life happens! Let's create a 25-minute version of today's workout so you can get back on track.";
}

// High stress scenario
if (context.stressLevel > 7 || context.energyLevel < 4) {
    return "I see you're dealing with some stress. Exercise is great for that, but let's keep the intensity moderate - we want to help, not add to the stress.";
}
```

### **Goal-Specific Advice**
```javascript
// Sport-specific coaching
if (context.sport === 'basketball' && context.seasonPhase === 'preseason') {
    return "Since basketball season starts in 6 weeks, we're focusing on explosive power and agility. Today's plyometrics will help your first step quickness - think of it as training your muscles to fire faster when you need to beat a defender.";
}
```

### **Performance Feedback**
```javascript
// High RPE feedback
if (context.averageRPE > 8.5) {
    return "You've been pushing hard lately (average RPE of 8.5+). Your dedication is awesome, but let's add an extra recovery day this week to avoid burnout.";
}
```

## Coaching Scenarios

### **Missed Workouts**
- **Encouraging Return**: "Welcome back! Taking 3 days off wasn't a setback - sometimes your body needs that reset."
- **Shorter Sessions**: "Let's start with a lighter session to ease back in - maybe 25-30 minutes."
- **Motivation**: "You're building a real habit here. Consistency like this is what separates people who see results."

### **High Stress Days**
- **Recovery Focus**: "I see you're dealing with some stress. Let's keep the intensity moderate today."
- **Stress Management**: "Exercise is great for stress, but we want to help, not add to it."
- **Energy Conservation**: "Your energy levels suggest you might be overreaching. Let's dial it back."

### **Plateau Periods**
- **Explanation**: "Your progress has leveled off - this is totally normal! It means your body has adapted."
- **Program Changes**: "Let's try a deload week - drop to 85% weight but focus on perfect form."
- **New Challenges**: "Time to switch things up with some new challenges."

### **Injury Concerns**
- **Conservative Approach**: "I'm not a doctor, but if you're experiencing pain during squats, let's skip it today."
- **Alternative Exercises**: "Let's try a safer alternative and avoid anything that causes discomfort."
- **Safety First**: "When in doubt, it's always better to be safe."

### **Low Energy Feedback**
- **Nutrition Suggestions**: "Your energy levels suggest we should look at your nutrition timing."
- **Sleep Focus**: "Let's focus on sleep quality and maybe try some lighter, more enjoyable workouts."
- **Recovery Emphasis**: "Your muscles are telling you they need some TLC."

## Response Templates

### **Progression Templates**

        plateau: "Your {exercise} has plateaued around {weight}lbs. This is normal after {weeks} weeks of gains. Let's try a deload week - drop to 85% weight but focus on perfect form.",
        breakthrough: "Wow! You just hit a new PR on {exercise} - {weight}lbs! That's {percentage}% stronger than last month. Your consistency is paying off!"
    },
    motivation: {
        streak: "Week {number} in the books! You're building a real habit here. Consistency like this is what separates people who see results from those who don't.",
        return: "Welcome back! Taking {days} days off wasn't a setback - sometimes your body needs that reset. Let's ease back in."
    }
};

    fatigue: "Your energy levels suggest you might be overreaching. Let's dial it back and focus on quality over quantity today."
}
```
