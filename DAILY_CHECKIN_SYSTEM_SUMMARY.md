# Ignite Fitness - Daily Readiness System

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive daily check-in system with smart workout adjustments based on sleep, stress, energy, and soreness levels. The system provides guided daily assessments with real-time workout intensity adjustments and coach messages.

## Daily Check-in Interface

### Four Key Metrics with Descriptive Sliders

#### **😴 Sleep Assessment**
- **Hours Input**: Number input (4-12 hours, 0.5 step increments)
- **Quality Slider**: 1-10 scale with descriptive labels
  - 1: "😴 Terrible sleep, tossing and turning"
  - 5: "😐 Average sleep, okay rest"
  - 10: "😴 Perfect sleep, incredibly refreshed"

#### **😟 Stress Level**
- **Slider**: 1-10 scale with emotional descriptions
  - 1: "😌 Completely relaxed, no worries"
  - 5: "😟 Moderate stress, affecting focus"
  - 10: "🤯 Overwhelming stress, can't function"

#### **⚡ Energy Level**
- **Slider**: 1-10 scale with energy descriptions
  - 1: "😴 Exhausted, can barely move"
  - 5: "😐 Average energy, feeling okay"
  - 10: "⚡ Incredible energy, could run a marathon"

#### **💪 Soreness Level**
- **Slider**: 1-10 scale with physical descriptions
  - 1: "💪 Feel amazing, no soreness"
  - 5: "😐 Moderate soreness, aware of it"
  - 10: "😵 Extreme soreness, can't move normally"

## Smart Workout Adjustments

### **Intensity Reduction Logic**
```javascript
// Auto-adjust workout intensity based on readiness
if (sleepHours < 6 || stressLevel > 7 || energyLevel < 4) {
    workoutIntensity *= 0.8; // Reduce by 20%
    addCoachMessage("Based on your readiness, let's take it easier today");
}
```

### **Recovery Workout Suggestions**
```javascript
if (sorenessLevel > 7) {
    suggestRecoveryWorkout();
    addCoachMessage("High soreness detected - focusing on mobility and recovery");
}
```

### **Readiness Score Calculation**
- **Formula**: Weighted average of sleep, stress, energy, and soreness
- **Range**: 1-10 scale
- **Real-time Updates**: Score updates as user adjusts sliders
- **Coach Messages**: Personalized feedback based on score

## Database Schema

### **Daily Readiness Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS daily_readiness (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    sleep_hours DECIMAL(3,1),
    sleep_quality INTEGER CHECK (sleep_quality >= 1 AND sleep_quality <= 10),
    stress_level INTEGER CHECK (stress_level >= 1 AND stress_level <= 10),
    energy_level INTEGER CHECK (energy_level >= 1 AND energy_level <= 10),
    soreness_level INTEGER CHECK (soreness_level >= 1 AND soreness_level <= 10),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(user_id, date)
);
```

### **Computed Readiness Score**
```sql
ALTER TABLE daily_readiness
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS readiness_score INT
GENERATED ALWAYS AS (
    LEAST(10, GREATEST(1,
        CEIL( (COALESCE(energy_level,5) + 11 - COALESCE(stress_level,5)
              + COALESCE(sleep_quality,5) + 11 - COALESCE(soreness_level,5)) / 4 )
    ))
) STORED;
```

### **Performance Indexes**
- `idx_daily_readiness_user_date` - User and date queries
- `idx_daily_readiness_date` - Date-based queries
- `idx_daily_readiness_readiness_score` - Score-based analytics
