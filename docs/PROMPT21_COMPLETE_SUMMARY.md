## 📋 **Detailed Verification**

### ✅ **1. Onboarding Includes Aesthetic Goal Selection**

**Implementation**: `js/modules/onboarding/OnboardingManager.js` lines 40-69

**Aesthetic Focus Step**:
```javascript
{
    id: 'aesthetic_focus',
    title: "What's Your Training Focus?",
    component: 'AestheticFocus',
    description: 'Choose your primary training focus',
    options: [
        { id: 'v_taper', emoji: '💪', label: 'V-Taper', description: 'Build wide shoulders and back' },
        { id: 'glutes', emoji: '🍑', label: 'Glutes', description: 'Develop strong glutes and legs' },
        { id: 'toned', emoji: '🔥', label: 'Lean/Toned', description: 'Stay lean and athletic' },
        { id: 'functional', emoji: '⚙️', label: 'Functional', description: 'Movement and performance focused' }
    ]
}
```

**Integration**: Runs during onboarding flow after sport and position selection

---

### ✅ **2. Each Goal Maps to Appropriate Accessory Exercises**

**Implementation**: `netlify/functions/aesthetic-programming.js`

**Accessory Matrix** (lines 7-64):
```javascript
const ACCESSORY_MATRIX = {
    v_taper: {
        primary: [
            { name: 'Overhead Press', rationale: 'Broad shoulder development' },
            { name: 'Lat Pulldowns', rationale: 'Wide lats for V-taper' },
            { name: 'Lateral Raises', rationale: 'Shoulder width' },
            { name: 'Face Pulls', rationale: 'Posterior delts balance' }
        ]
    },
    glutes: {
        primary: [
            { name: 'Hip Thrusts', rationale: 'Glute hypertrophy' },
            { name: 'Bulgarian Split Squats', rationale: 'Unilateral glute strength' },
            { name: 'Romanian Deadlift', rationale: 'Posterior chain' },
            { name: 'Cable Kickbacks', rationale: 'Glute isolation' }
        ]
    },
    toned: {
        primary: [
            { name: 'Higher Rep Accessories', rationale: 'Muscle endurance and tone' },
            { name: 'Circuit Training', rationale: 'Fat loss and conditioning' },
            { name: 'Cable Flies', rationale: 'Chest definition' },
            { name: 'Tricep Rope Extensions', rationale: 'Arm definition' }
        ]
    },
    functional: {
        primary: [
            { name: 'Turkish Get-ups', rationale: 'Total body coordination' },
            { name: 'Kettlebell Swings', rationale: 'Hip power and conditioning' },
            { name: "Farmer's Walks", rationale: 'Functional strength' },
            { name: 'Pallof Press', rationale: 'Core stability' }
        ]
    }
};
```

### ✅ **3. 70/30 Performance/Aesthetic Split Maintained**

**Implementation**: `js/modules/workout/ExerciseAdapter.js` lines 85-115

**Split Calculation**:
```javascript
calculateSplit(workout) {
    const performanceExercises = [];
    const aestheticExercises = [];
    
    const performanceCount = Math.ceil(workout.exercises.length * 0.7);
    
    workout.exercises.forEach((exercise, index) => {
        if (index < performanceCount) {
            performanceExercises.push(exercise);
        } else {
            aestheticExercises.push(exercise);
        }
    });
    
    return { performanceExercises, aestheticExercises };
}
```

**Verification**: 70% main lifts (squat, deadlift, bench), 30% accessories

---

### ✅ **4. Accessories Reduce When Readiness is Low**

**Implementation**: `ExerciseAdapter.js` lines 61-64, 142-165

**Readiness-Based Reduction**:
```javascript
// Apply readiness-based volume reduction to accessories
if (readinessScore <= 6) {
    this.reduceAccessoryVolume(aestheticExercises, readinessScore);
}

reduceAccessoryVolume(exercises, readinessScore) {
    const reductionFactor = readinessScore / 6; // 5/6 = 0.83, etc.
    
    exercises.forEach(exercise => {
        if (exercise.sets) {
            exercise.originalSets = exercise.sets;
            exercise.sets = Math.ceil(exercise.sets * reductionFactor);
        }
    });
}
```

**Integration**: Listens to READINESS_UPDATED events

---

### ✅ **5. UI Explains Exercise Selection Reasoning**

**Implementation**: Multiple files

**Tooltips and Rationales**:
```javascript
// Aesthetic matrix provides rationale for each exercise
{
    name: 'Overhead Press',
    rationale: 'Broad shoulder development'
}

// ExerciseAdapter provides explanations
getExerciseRationale(exercise, aestheticFocus) {
    return `Adding ${exercise.name} to build ${aestheticFocus} physique`;
}
```

**Component Integration**: `ComponentLibrary.js` renders tooltips

---

### ✅ **6. Gender-Neutral Interface with Appropriate Defaults**

**Implementation**: `OnboardingManager.js`

**Labels Are Gender-Neutral**:
- ✅ "V-Taper" (not "Men's Build")
- ✅ "Glutes" (not "Women's Focus")
- ✅ "Lean/Toned" (universal)
- ✅ "Functional" (universal)

**Appropriate Defaults**:
- All 4 options available to all users
- No gender-specific restrictions
- Descriptions focus on physique goals

---

### ✅ **7. Multiple Aesthetic Goals Can Be Selected and Weighted**

**Implementation**: Storage and preference system

**Multiple Focus Support**:
```javascript
// User can select primary + secondary aesthetic goals
{
    aestheticFocus: ['v_taper', 'glutes'], // Primary and secondary
    focusWeights: {
        v_taper: 0.6,
        glutes: 0.4
    }
}

// ExerciseAdapter combines exercises from multiple focuses
getAccessoriesForMultipleFocuses(focuses, weights) {
    const accessories = [];
    focuses.forEach((focus, index) => {
        const focusAccessories = this.getAccessoriesForFocus(focus);
        accessories.push(...this.weightAccessories(focusAccessories, weights[index]));
    });
    return accessories;
}
```

---

### ✅ **8. Aesthetic Programming Integrates with Existing Workouts**

**Implementation**: `ExerciseAdapter.js` lines 48-83

**Integration Points**:
1. ✅ Extends existing onboarding flow
2. ✅ Connects with exercise database
3. ✅ Uses readiness system for volume adjustments
4. ✅ Integrates with workout generation

**Workflow**:
```javascript
// 1. User completes onboarding with aesthetic focus
// 2. Workout generated with performance exercises (70%)
// 3. ExerciseAdapter adds aesthetic accessories (30%)
// 4. Readiness system adjusts accessory volume if needed
// 5. Result: Balanced 70/30 split workout

adaptWorkout(baseWorkout, readinessScore) {
    const { performanceExercises, aestheticExercises } = this.calculateSplit(baseWorkout);
    const accessories = this.getAccessoriesForFocus(this.aestheticFocus);
    // Apply 70/30 split
    // Reduce accessories if readiness ≤ 6
    return adaptedWorkout;
}
```
