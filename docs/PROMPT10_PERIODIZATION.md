# Prompt 10 - Periodization + Soccer Calendar âœ…

## âœ… **COMPLETION STATUS: 100%**

### **Done Means Checklist**

âœ… 4-week blocks (W1-3 progressive, W4 deload)  
âœ… Pre-season bias strength and power  
âœ… In-season bias maintenance and sprint/agility  
âœ… User can flag important matches  
âœ… Taper auto-applies (volume -30%, intensity -10%)  
âœ… Periodization view shows current block, next block  
âœ… Phase pill persists in header  
âœ… Marking a key match in 10 days updates next 2 weeks with rationale

## ðŸ“‹ **Implementation Summary**

### **4-Week Block Pattern** âœ…

**Progressive Loading (Weeks 1-3):**
```javascript
Week 1: 80% volume, 93% intensity
Week 2: 90% volume, 97% intensity
Week 3: 100% volume, 100% intensity
Week 4: 60% volume, 85% intensity (deload)
```

**Deload Week Logic:**
- 40% volume reduction
- 15% intensity reduction
- Allows supercompensation

---

### **Season-Specific Biases** âœ…

**Pre-Season:**
- Focus: Strength and power
- Intensity: High
- Volume: Progressive loading
- Goal: Build base

**In-Season:**
- Focus: Maintenance and sprint/agility
- Intensity: Moderate
- Volume: Moderate (avoid fatigue)
- Goal: Maintain performance

**Off-Season:**
- Focus: Strength development
- Intensity: High
- Volume: High
- Goal: Build strength

---

### **Key Match Flagging** âœ…

**Flag a Match:**
```javascript
await SeasonalPrograms.flagKeyMatch(
    new Date('2024-06-15'),
    'Liverpool'
);

// Returns:
{
    date: '2024-06-15T00:00:00Z',
    opponent: 'Liverpool',
    type: 'key_match',
    flagged: true,
    taperApplied: true,
    taperDays: 10
}
```

**Storage:** `key_matches` table  
**Auto-Update:** Next 2 blocks recalculated  

---

### **Automatic Tapering** âœ…

**Taper Rules:**
- Trigger: 10 days before key match
- Volume reduction: -30%
- Intensity reduction: -10%
- Duration: 1 week taper

**Example:**
```javascript
Normal Week 2: volume 90%, intensity 97%
Tapered Week 2: volume 63%, intensity 87%
Rationale: "Tapering for Liverpool (June 15)"
```

---

### **Periodization View** âœ…

**Components:**
1. **Phase Pill** (header)
   - Shows current phase (In-Season, Pre-Season, etc.)
   - Color-coded
   - Emoji indicator

2. **Progress Bar**
   - Current block progress
   - Week X of 4

3. **Training Blocks**
   - Current block details
   - Next block preview

4. **Recommendations**
   - Taper alerts
   - Deload reminders

---

## **Example Flow** âœ…

### **Flag a Key Match:**

**Step 1: User Flags Match**
```javascript
User: "Flag June 15 vs Liverpool"
System: flagsKeyMatch(new Date('2024-06-15'), 'Liverpool')
```

**Step 2: System Updates Next 2 Weeks**
```javascript
Block 2, Week 2:
  Before: volume 90%, intensity 97%
  After:  volume 63%, intensity 87%
  Reason: "Tapering for Liverpool (June 15)"
```

**Step 3: View Shows Taper**
```javascript
Periodization View:
  Current Block: Block 2 (50% complete)
  Next Block: Block 3 (starts in 14 days)
  Alert: "Tapering scheduled for Liverpool match"
```

---

### **Seasonal Biases Applied:**

**Pre-Season (Jan-Feb):**
```javascript
Week 1: Heavy squats (strength focus)
Week 2: Power cleans (power focus)
Week 3: Max effort sprints (power focus)
Week 4: Deload (recovery)
```

**In-Season (Mar-Aug):**
```javascript
Week 1: Maintenance lifting (maintenance)
Week 2: Sprint work (agility focus)
Week 3: Light upper body (maintenance)
Week 4: Deload (recovery)
```

---

## **Rationale Generation** âœ…

**Taper Week Rationale:**
```
"Tapering for key match (Liverpool, June 15). Volume reduced 30%, intensity reduced 10% to optimize performance. Training focus shifts to sprint/agility to maintain match fitness."
```

**Deload Week Rationale:**
```
"Deload week - 40% volume reduction, 15% intensity reduction. Allows supercompensation and prevents overreaching."
```

---

## **Phase Pill Persistence** âœ…

**Header Display:**
```html
<div class="phase-pill" style="--phase-color: #00a651">
    <span class="phase-emoji">âš½</span>
    <span class="phase-label">In-Season</span>
    <span class="phase-subtitle">Maintenance</span>
</div>
```

**Always Visible:** Yes (persists in header)  
**Updates:** Based on current date and phase
