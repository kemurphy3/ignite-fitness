## üìä **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Risk Assessment Algorithm**
```javascript
Risk Score Calculation:
- Sleep Quality: 20% weight (inverse - lower sleep = higher risk)
- Muscle Soreness: 15% weight (direct - higher soreness = higher risk)
- Stress Level: 10% weight (direct - higher stress = higher risk)
- Training Load: 25% weight (moderated - excessive load = higher risk)
- Movement Quality: 15% weight (inverse - lower quality = higher risk)
- Injury History: 15% weight (direct - more history = higher risk)

Risk Level Determination:
- 7-10: Very High
- 5-6.9: High
- 3-4.9: Moderate
- 1-2.9: Low-Moderate
- 0-0.9: Low
```

### **Movement Screen Framework**
```javascript
const MOVEMENT_SCREENS = {
    overhead_squat: {
        checkpoints: {
            frontal_view: ['knee_valgus', 'foot_flattening', 'asymmetries'],
            sagittal_view: ['forward_lean', 'heel_lift', 'arms_fall'],
            posterior_view: ['heel_rise', 'knee_cave', 'asymmetric_shift']
        },
        scoring: {
            3: 'Performs movement correctly without compensation',
            2: 'Performs movement with minor deviations',
            1: 'Unable to perform movement or major compensations'
        },
        corrective_exercises: {
            knee_valgus: ['glute_activation', 'hip_strengthening', 'VMO_strengthening']
