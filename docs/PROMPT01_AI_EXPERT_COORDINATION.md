2. **Sport performance** (Sports) - Game-day adjustments
3. **Progressive overload** (Strength) - Main lifting
4. **Aesthetic preferences** (Aesthetics) - Accessories (30%)
5. **User constraints** - Time, equipment, readiness

### **Conflict Resolution** ‚úÖ

**Game -1 Day:**
- ‚ùå Remove heavy leg work
- ‚úÖ Upper body light only
- Rationale: "Game tomorrow - upper body maintenance only"

**Knee Pain:**
- ‚ùå Remove back squats
- ‚úÖ Substitute goblet squats
- Rationale: "Safer knee flexion with neutral spine"

**Low Readiness:**
- ‚ùå Normal volume
- ‚úÖ Reduce volume by 30%
- Rationale: "Reduced volume due to low readiness (‚â§4) - prioritize recovery"

**Glutes Focus:**
- ‚úÖ Add hip thrusts, Bulgarian splits, RDLs
- Rationale: "Maximize glute hypertrophy for aesthetic goals"
