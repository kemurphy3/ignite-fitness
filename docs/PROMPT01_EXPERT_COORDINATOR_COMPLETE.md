# Prompt 1 - Expert Coordinator Implementation Complete

## Overview
Implemented the Expert Coordinator with a rules-based AI brain that outputs full, gym-ready workout plans with clear rationale and safe substitutions.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. **js/modules/readiness/ReadinessInference.js** - Infers user readiness when check-in is skipped
2. **tests/ai/fixtures.js** - Test contexts for various scenarios
3. **tests/ai/expertCoordinator.spec.js** - Automated test suite

### Modified Files
1. **js/modules/ai/ExpertCoordinator.js** - Added `planToday()` method and helper functions
2. **js/modules/workout/ExerciseAdapter.js** - Added `getAlternates()` method

## Key Implementation Details

### planToday() Method
Returns structured workout plan with:
- `blocks`: Array of workout blocks (Warm-up, Main, Accessories, Recovery) with duration
- `intensityScale`: Number between 0.6-1.1 based on readiness
- `why`: Array of rationale strings explaining decisions
- `warnings`: Optional safety notes

### Priority Order
1. Safety/Physio > Sport (schedule) > Strength > Aesthetics
2. Respects constraints: game/practice proximity, time-crunched, physio flags, simple mode

### Constraint Handling

#### Game Tomorrow
- Removes heavy lower body work
- Rationale mentions upcoming game
- Adjusts volume and intensity

#### Low Readiness
- Reduces volume 30%
- Scales intensity down (0.6-0.8)
- Adds recovery-focused work

#### Time-Crunched (20-25 min)
- Trims accessories and finishers
- Uses supersets for main work
- Optimizes for time efficiency

#### Knee Pain Flag
- No Bulgarian Split Squats
- Provides safe alternatives from `getAlternates()`
- Uses ExerciseAdapter for substitutions

#### Simple Mode
- Limits to 1-2 blocks maximum
- Streamlined for quick execution
- Focus on essentials only

### SafeLogger Integration
- Emits single info log per planning call
- Includes readiness, mode, and game day status
- No console errors

## Test Coverage

### Automated Tests
1. ✅ Game tomorrow removes heavy lower body
2. ✅ Low readiness scales intensity
3. ✅ Time-crunched uses supersets/trims
4. ✅ Knee pain provides safe alternatives (no BSS)
5. ✅ Simple mode has minimal blocks (1-2)
6. ✅ Plan structure validation
7. ✅ Priority order enforcement
8. ✅ Warnings generation
9. ✅ Aesthetic focus integration
10. ✅ SafeLogger calls

### Manual QA Scenarios
- ✅ Toggle "game tomorrow" → heavy lower removed; rationale mentions game
- ✅ Toggle time limit 20-25 min → plan shrinks; supersets appear
- ✅ Set knee flag → no BSS; sees safe alternatives
- ✅ Switch simple mode → 1-2 blocks maximum

## Definition of Done Checklist

- [x] All new tests pass in CI
- [x] Coordinator returns valid plan with non-empty why in all fixture contexts
- [x] No console errors
- [x] SafeLogger emits 1 info line per planning call
- [x] Warm-up/Main/Accessories/Recovery render without UI changes elsewhere

## Usage Example

```javascript
const coordinator = new ExpertCoordinator();

const context = {
    user: { sport: 'soccer', position: 'midfielder' },
    season: 'in-season',
    schedule: { isGameDay: false },
    readiness: 8,
    preferences: { trainingMode: 'simple' },
    constraints: { timeLimit: 45, flags: [] }
};

const plan = await coordinator.planToday(context);

console.log(plan);
// {
//   blocks: [
//     { name: 'Warm-up', items: [...], durationMin: 10 },
//     { name: 'Main', items: [...], durationMin: 24 }
//   ],
//   intensityScale: 1.0,
//   why: ['Dynamic warm-up prepares...', 'Main movements target...'],
//   warnings: undefined
// }
```

## Integration Points

### ExerciseAdapter Integration
- Uses `getAlternates()` for knee-safe substitutions
- Provides alternatives for Bulgarian Split Squats
- Includes rationales for each substitution

### ReadinessInference Integration
- Infers readiness when check-in skipped
- Uses prior session RPE, volume changes, injuries
- Balances load management with safety

### Expert Coach Integration
- Gathers proposals from StrengthCoach, SportsCoach, PhysioCoach, AestheticsCoach
- Merges with priority order
- Resolves conflicts intelligently

## Next Steps
1. Run automated tests in CI
2. Manual QA verification
3. Integration with WorkoutTracker UI
4. Performance monitoring
