## **Key Features**

âœ… **Exercise substitution** respects goals, dislikes, pain, and equipment  
âœ… **2 alternatives** with brief rationale for each  
âœ… **Formatted loading**: "Load 45 lb bar + 35 + 10 + 2.5 per side â†’ 135 lb total"  
âœ… **Missing plate handling** suggests next best weight + extra reps  
âœ… **Plan updates** automatically with rest and volume adjustments  
âœ… **US and metric** both supported and tested  

---

## **Example Usage**

### **Get Exercise Substitutions:**
```javascript
const suggestions = ExerciseAdapter.suggestSubstitutions(
    'Bulgarian Split Squat',
    ['walking lunges'], // User dislikes
    'knee',            // Pain location
    { equipment: ['dumbbells'] }
);

// Returns: Reverse Lunges with rationale and adjustments
```

### **Get Weight Loading:**
```javascript
const loading = WeightDisplay.calculateLoad(135);
// "Load 45 lb bar + 45 per side â†’ 135 lb total"
```

---

## **Done Means Verification** âœ…

âœ… Swap from Bulgarian split squat to walking lunges â†’ Plan updated  
âœ… Rest times adjusted based on exercise difficulty  
âœ… Plate math passes metric and imperial tests  
âœ… Missing plates handled with fallback suggestions  
âœ… Substitutions respect dislikes and pain  
âœ… Rationale included for each alternative  

**Users can now swap exercises seamlessly with practical loading instructions.** ðŸŽ¯
