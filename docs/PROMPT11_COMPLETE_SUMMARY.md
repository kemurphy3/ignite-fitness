# Prompt 1.1 - Adaptive Load & Readiness Engine ✅

## **COMPLETION STATUS: 100%**

### **Done Means Checklist**

✅ Daily check-in modal captures sleep/stress/soreness/energy  
✅ Readiness score calculates correctly with proper weighting  
✅ Low readiness triggers recovery session substitution  
✅ Sport conflicts prevent inappropriate workout timing  
✅ Auto-deload activates every 4th week  
✅ RPE feedback adjusts subsequent workout loads  
✅ Unit tests cover 12+ scenarios  
✅ UI shows reasoning for workout modifications  

---

## **Implementation Summary**

### **1. Daily Readiness System**
✅ Weighted formula (30/25/25/20) implemented in `DailyCheckIn.js`  
✅ Captures 4 metrics: sleep, stress, soreness, energy  
✅ Automatic adjustments based on readiness score  

### **2. Load Adjustment Engine**
✅ `ProgressionEngine.js` handles RPE-based adjustments  
✅ ±5% intensity changes based on previous RPE  
✅ Auto-deload every 4th week (20% volume reduction)  
✅ Forced deload for low readiness (3+ days)  

### **3. Conflict Resolution**
✅ `ConflictResolver.js` handles sport schedule conflicts  
✅ Game day -1: Upper body light (RPE ≤ 6)  
✅ Game day -2: No heavy legs (RPE ≤ 7)  
✅ Back-to-back training detection  
✅ Body part overlap prevention  

### **4. Backend Processing**
✅ `netlify/functions/readiness-processor.js` created  
✅ Server-side readiness calculation  
✅ Conflict detection API  
✅ Workout adjustment API  

### **5. Testing & Verification**
✅ `test-prompt11-verification.js` created  
✅ All 8 "Done Means" criteria verified  
✅ Integration tests ready

## **Key Features**

### **Adaptive Intelligence Loop**
1. User completes daily check-in
2. Readiness score calculated (weighted)
3. Workout adjusted based on readiness
4. RPE collected post-workout
5. Next session adjusted from RPE feedback
6. Auto-deload every 4th week
7. Game-day scheduling respected

### **Load Adjustment Examples**

**Low Readiness (≤4)**:
- Workout: Recovery session
- Intensity: 50% reduction
- Type: Mobility, light cardio
- Message: "Recovery session recommended"

**Moderate Readiness (5-7)**:
- Workout: Standard session
- Intensity: 10% reduction
- Message: "Moderate readiness - reducing intensity by 10%"

**High Readiness (8-10)**:
- Workout: Standard session
- Intensity: Full load
- Message: "Excellent readiness - ready for full intensity"

**Game Day -1**:
- Workout: Upper body only
- Max RPE: 6
- Message: "Game tomorrow - upper body light session only"

**Deload Week**:
- Volume: -20%
- Intensity: Maintained
- Message: "Deload week - reducing volume by 20% for active recovery"
