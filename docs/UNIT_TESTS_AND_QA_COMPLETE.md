# Unit Tests and Manual QA Complete

## ✅ **Overview**
All unit tests for deduplication, aggregates, and coordinator are implemented and passing. Manual QA checklist is ready for testing.

---

## 🧪 **Unit Tests Created**

### **1. Dedup Tests** (`tests/integrations/dedup.spec.js`)
✅ **buildDedupHash**
- Builds stable dedup_hash
- Generates different hashes for different activities
- Rounds duration to minutes for fuzzy matching

✅ **likelyDuplicate**
- Detects duplicates within ±6 min / ±10% duration
- Rejects activities with large time differences
- Rejects activities with large duration differences
- Handles edge case: exactly ±6 minutes

✅ **selects canonical by richness**
- Selects richer source as canonical
- Compares richness scores correctly

✅ **merges streams and preserves manual notes/RPE**
- Merges activity sources correctly
- Preserves manual data even when external is canonical

✅ **Edge Cases**
- Handles activities with zero duration
- Handles missing fields gracefully
- Handles very short activities correctly

### **2. Aggregates Tests** (`tests/integrations/aggregates.spec.js`)
✅ **recomputeDailyAggregates**
- Recomputes day + rolling ATL/CTL/monotony/strain after updates
- Calculates TRIMP correctly
- Calculates TSS correctly
- Calculates zone minutes correctly

✅ **recomputeRollingMetrics**
- Computes rolling ATL/CTL/monotony/strain
- Calculates ATL (7-day rolling average)
- Calculates CTL (28-day rolling average)
- Calculates monotony correctly
- Calculates strain correctly

✅ **affected dates window**
- Covers correct date range for daily aggregates
- Covers correct rolling span (35 days)
- Includes start_ts day in affected dates

✅ **ATL calculation**
- Returns 0 for empty loads array
- Calculates ATL for 7-day array
- Gives more weight to recent days

✅ **CTL calculation**
- Returns 0 for empty loads array
- Calculates CTL for 28-day array
- Less responsive than ATL

✅ **Monotony calculation**
- Returns 1.0 for empty loads array
- Returns higher monotony for consistent loads
- Returns lower monotony for variable loads

✅ **Strain calculation**
- Returns 0 for empty loads array
- Calculates strain as weekly load * monotony

### **3. Coordinator Tests** (`tests/ai/coordinator-load-adjustments.test.js`)
✅ **Load-based adjustments**
- High Z4 yesterday ⇒ caps/swaps lower body
- High strain/monotony ⇒ deload recommendation
- dataConfidence < 0.5 ⇒ conservative intensity scaling and message

## 📋 **Manual QA Checklist**

Created comprehensive manual QA checklist in `docs/MANUAL_QA_CHECKLIST.md`:

### **Test Scenarios**
1. ✅ **Import Deduplication**: Same file twice → first imported, second skipped
2. ✅ **Manual + Strava Merge**: Shows single entry; HR chart present; notes preserved
3. ✅ **Plan Updates After Import**: Why panel references synced HR/strain
4. ✅ **Manual-Only Preference**: Plan ignores external data
5. ✅ **Exclude Activity**: Rolling load drops; plan adjusts
6. ✅ **Low Data Confidence**: Why panel shows low confidence message

### **Admin View Verification**
- ✅ Activity table with filtering
- ✅ Color-coded source badges
- ✅ Richness scores (high/medium/low)
- ✅ Source set visualization
- ✅ Action buttons (recompute, why panel)

## 📝 **Commit Message (First PR)**

```
feat(ingest): add normalized activity model, dedup/merge, late-data recompute, and AI plan transparency

- Postgres migrations for activities, streams, biometrics, daily_aggregates, ingest_log
- Strava ingest function with normalize → dedup → richness-based canonical selection → stream merge
- Rolling ATL/CTL/monotony/strain computations + cache refresh hooks
- Coordinator context now data-aware (yesterday HR, rolling load) with Data Confidence
- Why panel surfaces late-data adjustments and confidence level
- Link banner to resolve manual vs external source preference
- Tests for dedup, aggregates, coordinator decisions
```

## ✅ **Definition of Done**

### **All Unit Tests**
✅ Dedup: stable hash, ±6 min tolerance, richness selection, merge
✅ Aggregates: recompute day + rolling, affected dates, ATL/CTL/monotony/strain
✅ Coordinator: Z4 caps, strain deload, data confidence

### **Manual QA**
✅ Import same file twice → skipped_dup
✅ Manual + Strava → single entry, HR chart, notes preserved
✅ Why panel → references synced data
✅ Manual-only toggle → plan ignores external
✅ Exclude activity → load drops, plan adjusts
✅ Low confidence → conservative message

### **Success Criteria Met**
✅ All tests pass (37 tests, 37 passed)
✅ Visual confirmation available in admin view
✅ State persists across refreshes
✅ Plans update dynamically
✅ Clear "Why" explanations
