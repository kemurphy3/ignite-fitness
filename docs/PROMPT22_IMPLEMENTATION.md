- Exercise alternatives suggested

**UI Elements**:
```html

```

#### **2. Rule Engine** ‚úÖ

**Knee Pain ‚Üí Goblet Squat + Hip Stretches**:
```javascript
if (location === 'knee' && painLevel >= 7) {
    alternatives: ['Goblet Squat', 'Box Squat', 'Leg Press']
    correctiveExercises: ['hip_strengthening', 'glute_activation', 'VMO_strengthening']
    message: 'For knee discomfort, try lighter loads and focus on hip and glute strengthening.'
}
```

**Low Back ‚Üí Cat-Cow + Lighter RDL**:
```javascript
if (location === 'low back' && painLevel >= 7) {
    alternatives: ['Cat-Cow Mobility', 'Lighter RDL', 'Romanian Deadlift']
    correctiveExercises: ['cat_cow', 'mobility_work']
    message: 'For low back discomfort, avoid excessive spinal loading and focus on mobility.'
}
```

**Shoulder ‚Üí Band External Rotations**:
```javascript
if (location === 'shoulder' && painLevel >= 7) {
    alternatives: ['Band External Rotations', 'Wall Slides', 'Face Pulls']
    correctiveExercises: ['band_external_rotations', 'shoulder_mobility']
    message: 'For shoulder discomfort, avoid overhead movements and focus on posterior delt work.'
}
```

#### **3. Educational Tone Only - No Diagnosis** ‚úÖ

**All Responses Include**:
```javascript
educationalNote: '‚ö†Ô∏è These are exercise suggestions only, not medical advice. 
Consult a healthcare professional if pain persists.'
```

**Modal Disclaimer**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

This application provides exercise suggestions and modifications only. 
It is NOT a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

We do NOT diagnose medical conditions
We provide educational information about exercise modifications only
```

#### **4. Injury Flags Logging** ‚úÖ

**Storage**: `injury_flags` table via `StorageManager.saveInjuryFlag()`

**Logged Data**:
```javascript
{
    userId: 'user_001',
    date: '2024-01-15',
    exerciseName: 'Squat',
    bodyLocation: 'knee',
    painLevel: 7,
    painType: 'sharp',
    suggestions: { ... },
    timestamp: '2024-01-15T10:30:00Z'
}
```

**Integration**:
```javascript
// Automatically logs to injury_flags on submission
await InjuryCheck.handlePainReport(painData, exerciseName);

// Retrieves pain history
const painHistory = InjuryCheck.getPainHistory(userId);
```

#### **5. Central Disclaimer Module** ‚úÖ
**File**: `js/modules/core/LegalCopy.js`

**Features**:
- Timestamped acceptance tracking
- Multiple disclaimer types (injury assessment, general fitness)
- Required disclaimers cannot be skipped
- Persistent storage of acceptances
- Event emission on acceptance

**Usage**:
```javascript
// Show and require acceptance
const accepted = await LegalCopy.showDisclaimer('injury_assessment');

// Check if already accepted
if (LegalCopy.isAccepted('injury_assessment')) {
    // Proceed
}

// Get acceptance timestamp
const timestamp = LegalCopy.getAcceptanceTimestamp('injury_assessment');
```

## üîß **Implementation Details**

### **Rule Engine Logic**

**Severity Categories**:
- **High (7-10)**: Significant modifications, alternative exercises, corrective work
- **Moderate (4-6)**: Reduced load, form focus, minor modifications
- **Low (1-3)**: Education, warm-up emphasis, monitor

**Knee Pain Rules**:
```javascript
High (7-10):
- Avoid deep squats
- Use Goblet Squat or Box Squat
- Add hip stretches
- Focus on glute/hip strengthening

Moderate (4-6):
- Reduce squat depth
- Lighter load
- Focus on form

Low (1-3):
- Warm up thoroughly
- Focus on form
```

**Low Back Pain Rules**:
```javascript
High (7-10):
- Avoid forward flexion
- Use Cat-Cow stretch
- Reduce RDL load
- Focus on mobility

Moderate (4-6):
- Reduce weight
- Focus on neutral spine
- Add breaks between sets

Low (1-3):
- Ensure proper warm-up
- Check form
```

**Shoulder Pain Rules**:
```javascript
High (7-10):
- Reduce overhead work
- Band external rotations
- Wall slides
- Focus on posterior delts

Moderate (4-6):
- Reduce ROM
- Lighter loads
- Band work focus

Low (1-3):
- Warm up rotators
- Focus on form
```

## üìä **Usage Examples**

### **Example 1: Knee Pain During Squat**
```javascript
// User reports pain during Squat
const assessment = await InjuryCheck.showPainAssessment('Squat', 'knee');

// Input: painLevel = 7, painType = 'sharp'
// Output:
{
    modifications: ['Avoid deep squats', 'Use goblet squat', 'Add hip stretches'],
    alternatives: ['Goblet Squat', 'Box Squat', 'Leg Press'],
    correctiveExercises: ['hip_strengthening', 'glute_activation', 'VMO_strengthening'],
    message: 'For knee discomfort, try lighter loads and focus on hip and glute strengthening.',
    educationalNote: '‚ö†Ô∏è Exercise suggestions only, not medical advice'
}

// Automatically logged to injury_flags
```

### **Example 2: Low Back Pain During Deadlift**
```javascript
// User reports pain during Deadlift
const assessment = await InjuryCheck.showPainAssessment('Deadlift', 'low back');

// Input: painLevel = 8, painType = 'aching'
// Output:
{
    modifications: ['Avoid forward flexion', 'Use cat-cow stretch', 'Reduce load'],
    alternatives: ['Cat-Cow Mobility', 'Lighter RDL', 'Romanian Deadlift'],
    correctiveExercises: ['cat_cow', 'mobility_work'],
    message: 'For low back discomfort, avoid excessive spinal loading and focus on mobility.'
}
```

### **Example 3: Shoulder Pain During Overhead Press**
```javascript
// User reports pain during Overhead Press
const assessment = await InjuryCheck.showPainAssessment('Overhead Press', 'shoulder');

// Input: painLevel = 6, painType = 'burning'
// Output:
{
    modifications: ['Reduce range of motion', 'Lighter loads', 'Band work'],
    alternatives: ['Incline Bench', 'Band External Rotations'],
    correctiveExercises: ['band_external_rotations'],
    message: 'Reduce overhead range of motion and incorporate shoulder stability work.'
}
```
