1. Export activities from Strava (see help instructions)
2. Navigate to dashboard or settings
3. Find Strava Import section
4. Click "Choose Strava Export File"
5. Select your exported activities.json file
6. Verify file uploads successfully
7. Verify activities appear in recent activities list

**Expected:** File uploads and processes without errors

#### Test: Upload Invalid File

3. Verify processing completes
4. Verify only last 100 activities kept

**Expected:** Large files processed efficiently

### 2. Activity Processing

#### Test: Activity Type Mapping
1. Upload file with various activity types:
   - Run, TrailRun, Treadmill → run
   - Ride, VirtualRide, IndoorRide → cycle

1. Upload file with activities containing:
   - Duration (moving_time, elapsed_time)
   - Distance
   - Heart rate (average_heartrate)
   - Start time (start_date_local)
2. Verify all data extracted correctly
3. Verify duration converted to minutes
4. Verify distance in meters
5. Verify heart rate in BPM

**Expected:** All relevant data extracted and converted

#### Test: Training Load Calculation
1. Upload activities with different characteristics:
   - Long run (60+ min, high HR)
   - Short recovery (30 min, low HR)
   - Strength training (45 min, moderate HR)
2. Verify training load scores calculated
3. Verify scores are 0-100 range
4. Verify higher intensity = higher load

**Expected:** Training load reflects activity intensity

### 3. Deduplication

#### Test: Duplicate Detection
1. Upload same activities.json file twice
2. Verify second upload shows duplicates skipped
3. Verify no duplicate activities in storage
4. Verify success message shows duplicate count

**Expected:** Duplicates detected and skipped

#### Test: Different Activities Not Duplicated
1. Upload activities with:
   - Same type, different time
   - Same time, different type
   - Same type/time, different duration
2. Verify all activities processed (not marked as duplicates)

**Expected:** Only true duplicates are skipped

### 4. Storage and Persistence

#### Test: Activities Saved
1. Upload activities
2. Refresh page
3. Verify activities still visible
4. Verify last import time preserved

**Expected:** Data persists across page refreshes

#### Test: User Isolation
1. Upload activities as User A
2. Switch to User B
3. Verify User B sees no activities
4. Upload activities as User B
5. Switch back to User A
6. Verify User A's activities still there

**Expected:** Activities isolated per user

### 5. UI Integration

#### Test: Import Button Visibility
1. Navigate to dashboard
2. Verify Strava Import section visible
3. Verify "Not Connected" status shown
4. Verify file upload area present

**Expected:** Import UI visible and functional

#### Test: Last Import Time Display
1. Upload activities
2. Verify "Last import: [timestamp]" shown
3. Verify timestamp is readable format
4. Upload again
5. Verify timestamp updates

**Expected:** Import time displayed and updated

#### Test: Recent Activities List
1. Upload activities
2. Verify recent activities list shows:
   - Activity type icon
   - Activity name
   - Time ago (Today, Yesterday, X days ago)
   - Duration and training load
3. Verify only last 5 activities shown
4. Verify remove button (×) present

**Expected:** Recent activities displayed correctly

### 6. Activity Management

#### Test: Remove Activity
1. Upload activities
2. Click remove button (×) on an activity
3. Verify activity removed from list
4. Verify activity removed from storage
5. Verify list updates immediately

**Expected:** Activities can be removed successfully

#### Test: Remove Non-existent Activity
1. Try to remove activity with invalid ID
2. Verify graceful handling
3. Verify no errors thrown
