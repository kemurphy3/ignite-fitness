# Ignite Fitness - Strava Integration & Load Management System

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive Strava integration and training load management system with TSS calculation, recovery tracking, and intelligent workout adjustments. The system processes external activity data and uses it for intelligent load management and workout modifications.

## Strava Data Processing

### **Activity Processing Pipeline**
```javascript
class StravaDataProcessor {
    processActivity(activity) {
        return {
            // Basic metrics
            duration: activity.moving_time,
            distance: activity.distance,
            calories: activity.calories,
            avgHeartRate: activity.average_heartrate,
            maxHeartRate: activity.max_heartrate,

            // Training stress calculation
            trainingStress: this.calculateTSS(activity),

            // Recovery impact estimation
            recoveryDebt: this.estimateRecoveryTime(activity),

            // Next workout adjustment
            workoutAdjustment: this.suggestAdjustment(activity)
        };
    }
}
```

### **TSS Calculation Formulas**
- **Running TSS (rTSS)**: Based on pace and duration with intensity factors
- **Cycling TSS (hrTSS)**: Based on heart rate reserve and duration
- **Swimming Load**: Heuristic calculation based on duration and distance
- **Weight Training Load**: Heuristic calculation based on duration and intensity

### **Recovery Impact Estimation**
- **Base Recovery Time**: Activity-specific base recovery hours
- **Intensity Multiplier**: Based on heart rate ratios
- **Distance Factor**: Additional recovery time for longer distances
- **Perceived Exertion**: Estimated RPE based on heart rate and duration

## Load Management System

### **Training Load Calculation**
```javascript
class LoadCalculator {
    calculateWeeklyLoad(sessions) {
        let totalLoad = 0;

        sessions.forEach(session => {
            session.exercises.forEach(exercise => {
                // Volume load: sets × reps × weight
                const volumeLoad = exercise.sets * exercise.reps * exercise.weight;

                // Intensity factor (RPE/10)
                const intensityFactor = exercise.rpe / 10;

                totalLoad += volumeLoad * intensityFactor;
            });
        });

        return {
            totalLoad,
            recommendation: this.getLoadRecommendation(totalLoad),
            nextDayIntensity: this.suggestNextDayIntensity(totalLoad)
        };
    }
}
```

### **Load Thresholds by Training Level**
- **Beginner**: 100 weekly load, 20 daily load, 48h recovery
- **Intermediate**: 200 weekly load, 40 daily load, 36h recovery
- **Advanced**: 300 weekly load, 60 daily load, 24h recovery
- **Elite**: 400 weekly load, 80 daily load, 18h recovery

### **Recovery Debt Tracking**
- **Total Recovery Debt**: Sum of all activity recovery times
- **Recovery Status**: Excellent, Good, Moderate, Poor
- **Recovery Recommendations**: Specific actions based on debt level
- **Risk Assessment**: Overtraining risk based on load and recovery

## Workout Adjustments

### **Adjustment Rules**
```javascript
const adjustmentRules = {
    longRun: {
        condition: activity => activity.type === 'Run' && activity.distance > 10000,
        adjustment: {
            legVolume: 0.8, // Reduce by 20%
            message: "Great run yesterday! Reducing leg volume to aid recovery."
        }
    },
    highIntensity: {
        condition: activity => activity.average_heartrate > (220 - userAge) * 0.85,
        adjustment: {
            overallIntensity: 0.9,
            message: "High intensity session detected. Taking it easier today."
        }
    }
};
```

### **Adjustment Types**
- **Long Run**: Reduce leg volume by 20%
- **High Intensity**: Reduce overall intensity by 10%
- **Long Ride**: Reduce leg volume by 30%
- **Intense Swim**: Reduce upper body volume by 20%
